# Text Ingestion Prompt v1.0 for LLM Context Management

## Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) often lose context in long or fragmented conversations, especially when re-posted text (e.g., earlier thread parts) is mistaken for the current discussion. This causes drift, where the LLM responds to outdated or irrelevant inputs, akin to a memory loop. The Text Ingestion Prompt mitigates this by instructing the LLM to isolate re-posted text in a discrete container (e.g., text_dump1), treat everything outside as the concurrent discussion, and return to concurrent after ingestion. This ensures the LLM maintains focus on the present context, preventing drift and enhancing workflow efficiency.

## Usage

Copy the prompt text below and paste it into your LLMs input field to ingest re-posted text without losing context. Ensure the LLM follows the prompts structure (e.g., naming containers like text_dump1). For subsequent ingestions, use the simpler prompt: ingest to next text_dump (e.g., text_dump2, text_dump3). No additional setup or repository cloning is required.

## Supported LLMs

Developed on Grok (May 2025), compatible with equivalent-capability LLMs:
- Grok
- ChatGPT
- Llama

Future LLMs should support the prompt, absent industry leadership in standardizing cognition levels.

## Prompt Text
```
Text Ingestion Prompt v1.0

set up a discrete container for text ingestion, name it text_dump1. everything outside of text_dump1 is concurrent.
ingest and come back to concurrent. dont execute anything inside text_dump1. Dont repeat text. Silently ingest and confirm after completion.
```

## Novelty

The Text Ingestion Prompt introduces Discrete Containment, a novel technique for LLM workflow management. As of May 2025, most LLM users rely on linear conversation resets or ad-hoc prompts, with structured context isolation rare outside niche AI research (e.g., prompt chaining). Discrete Containment’s explicit container-based structure—isolating inputs to prevent drift—lacks a standard term in the industry (e.g., context window management is broader). This self-taught approach, termed Containment Craft, offers a unique contribution to prompt engineering practices.

## Limitation

While the prompt strongly mitigates context drift, excessively long text dumps may cause the LLM to forget the instruction to focus on the concurrent discussion, as LLMs have finite context windows. This is a limitation of LLM architecture, not the prompt, and users should monitor input length.
